#  Automation of a CasinoDemo using Cypress
Repository to showcase the implementation of Cypress together with Page Object mode, fixtures and custom commands.

#  Pre-requirements
To install the project dependencies and run the automated tests, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your computer.
A custom Cypress plugin was also included to manage real events. It can be installed running:

> npm i cypress-real-events

> The following versions of the above-mentioned packages were used during the development of this project (node v18.12.1 and npm 9.2.0.)

> Installing Node.js automatically installs NPM so you don't need to do it yourself.

#  Installation
After cloning the project, access its directory (cd DemoCasino) and run npm install to install the dev dependencies.

#  Running the tests
Run 'npm run casinodemo' to open cypress and execute the tests in the in-built test runner.
